# Could I be your supervisor?

If you are considering applying for a PhD and are thinking of me as your supervisor, please read this information carefully.

## My Research Areas

I work primarily in:

- **Democratic Theory** - Especially epistemic approaches to democracy
- **Social Epistemology** - How groups form beliefs and make decisions
- **Environmental Ethics** - Particularly climate ethics and intergenerational justice
- **Philosophy of Social Science** - Methodology in political theory and political science
- **Politics, Philosophy & Economics (PPE)** - Interdisciplinary approaches

## What I Look For

I'm interested in supervising students who:

- Have a clear research question or area they want to explore
- Show familiarity with relevant philosophical literature
- Demonstrate strong analytical and writing skills
- Are interested in rigorous, methodologically sophisticated work
- Can work independently while benefiting from guidance

## Application Process

Before applying, please:

1. **Read my work** - Familiarize yourself with my publications, especially recent articles
2. **Identify overlap** - Explain how your research interests connect with mine
3. **Be specific** - Vague proposals about "democracy" or "ethics" are not helpful
4. **Show preparation** - Demonstrate you understand the existing literature

## What to Include

Your research proposal should:

- Outline a clear, focused research question
- Demonstrate knowledge of relevant literature
- Explain your methodology
- Show how your work contributes to the field
- Connect to my research expertise

## Department Information

The LSE Government Department offers excellent resources for PhD students in political theory. Please also review:

- [LSE PhD in Government requirements](https://www.lse.ac.uk/government)
- Funding opportunities and deadlines
- Other faculty members whose work might complement your interests

## Contact

If after reading this you believe we would be a good fit, please email me with:

- A clear subject line (e.g., "PhD Application - [Your Research Area]")
- Brief research proposal (1-2 pages)
- Academic CV
- Writing sample

I aim to respond to all serious inquiries, though I may not be able to supervise every interested student due to capacity constraints.
