My research sits at the intersection of political philosophy, epistemology, and social science methodology. I'm particularly interested in how groups make decisions and form beliefs, and what this means for democratic theory and practice.

## Current Projects

### Cohesion and Deliberative Decision-Making
*Open Society Foundation Grant (2024-2027)*

Working with Alex Voorhoeve and Richard Bradley on projects examining cohesion and deliberation in democratic decision-making. This research explores how social cohesion affects the quality of democratic deliberation and collective decision-making.

### Protection Against Severe Uncertainty
*Open Society Foundation Grant (2024-2027)*

Investigating how democratic institutions can be designed to make good decisions under conditions of severe uncertainty, particularly in contexts like climate change and technological disruption.

### Augmenting Intelligence through Collective Learning
*NSF RCN Associate (2024)*

Research associate at the NSF RCN grant for "Augmenting Intelligence through Collective Learning" examining how groups can enhance their collective intelligence through structured learning processes.

## Research Areas

### Democratic Theory
My work in democratic theory focuses on epistemic justifications for democracy. Rather than defending democracy solely on grounds of political equality or autonomy, I argue that democratic procedures are valuable because they tend to produce good decisions. This research draws on social choice theory, probability theory, and empirical studies of group decision-making.

**Key questions:**
- When should we trust democratic decisions?
- How can democratic institutions be designed to make better decisions?
- What are the epistemic limits of democracy?

### Social Epistemology
I investigate how groups form beliefs and aggregate information. This includes work on the wisdom of crowds, the role of expertise in democratic societies, and the conditions under which groups outperform individuals.

**Current focus:**
- Collective intelligence and group problem-solving
- The role of disagreement in knowledge production
- Information aggregation in political contexts

### Environmental Ethics
My environmental ethics research examines the ethical challenges posed by climate change and environmental degradation. I'm particularly interested in intergenerational justice and the ethics of uncertainty.

**Key themes:**
- Obligations to future generations
- Decision-making under uncertainty
- The precautionary principle
- Climate ethics and policy

### Philosophy of Social Science
I work on methodological questions in political theory and political science, including the role of formal methods, the relationship between normative and empirical theory, and the use of models in political philosophy.

**Areas of focus:**
- The role of mathematical models in political theory
- Computer simulations in social science
- Methodology in normative political theory

## Collaborations

I regularly collaborate with researchers across disciplines, including:
