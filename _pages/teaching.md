I teach courses in political philosophy, democratic theory, environmental ethics, and research methods at the undergraduate and graduate levels. My teaching emphasizes critical thinking, rigorous argumentation, and the integration of theoretical and empirical approaches.

## Current Courses

**GV4H4: Foundations of Political Theory**  
*MSc course • Autumn Term • Department of Government • LSE*

This course provides an introduction to the philosophical and methodological foundations of political theory, giving students a conceptual toolbox for addressing research questions in the field. The course introduces methodological debates in contemporary political theory, explores links between political theory and related disciplines, and familiarizes students with different approaches to political theorizing.

**GV4H5: The Political Philosophy of Environmental Change**  
*MSc course • Winter Term • Department of Government • LSE*

This course examines climate change from a political-philosophical perspective, drawing on analytical political philosophy, political theory, and environmental ethics.
