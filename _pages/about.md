I'm a Professor of Political Philosophy in the Department of Government at the London School of Economics. I work in democratic theory, the philosophy of the social sciences and topics relating to politics, philosophy and economics (PPE) more generally.

Among my research interests are group decisions, social epistemology (and especially epistemic justifications of democracy), the ethics of environmental change, and the methodology of political theory and political science.

## Research Areas

My work sits at the intersection of political philosophy, epistemology, and social science methodology. Key areas include:

- **Democratic Theory** - Epistemic justifications of democracy, group decision-making processes
- **Social Epistemology** - How groups form beliefs and knowledge, collective intelligence
- **Environmental Ethics** - Ethics of climate change, intergenerational justice, environmental policy
- **Philosophy of Social Science** - Methodology in political theory and political science
- **Politics, Philosophy & Economics** - Interdisciplinary approaches to social and political problems

## Current Projects

I'm currently working on several collaborative research projects funded by the Open Society Foundation, examining cohesion and deliberation in democratic decision-making, and protection against severe uncertainty in policy contexts.
