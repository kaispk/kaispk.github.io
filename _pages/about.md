I'm a Professor of Political Philosophy in the Department of
Government at the London School of Economics. I work in democratic
theory, the philosophy of the social sciences and topics relating to
politics, philosophy and economics (PPE) more generally. 

Among my research interests are group decisions, social epistemology
(and especially epistemic justifications of democracy), the ethics of
environmental change, and the methodology of political theory and
political science. More information is [here](/research).
