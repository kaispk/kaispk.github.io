Democratic societies have recently seen the emergence of populist
movements, including Trumpism, the Brexit movement, and rising
nationalism. Normative democratic theory seems disconnected from these
trends, because it does not directly address effects of institutions
on citizens’ mental features – their concepts, attitudes, and
experiences. Yet mental changes have important consequences for the
functioning and stability of any social order.

This book will present a “generative” theory of democracy: a value
theory of institutions that emphasises effects of institutions through
mental changes, so-called “generative effects”.
