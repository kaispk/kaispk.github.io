excerpt: 'We propose a cognitive-dissonance model of norm compliance to identify conditions for selfishly biased information acquisition. The model distinguishes between objective norm compliers, for whom the right action is a function of the state of the world, and subjective norm compliers, for whom it is a function of their belief. The source of moral wiggle room is not belief manipulation, but the coarseness of normative prescriptions under conditions of uncertainty.'
