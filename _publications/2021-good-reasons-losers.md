This article examines what democratic losers can reasonably expect from democratic procedures and when they have good reasons to accept democratic outcomes. I develop an epistemic approach to this question, arguing that losers' obligations depend on the epistemic properties of democratic procedures.

The paper addresses a fundamental question in democratic theory: when do democratic losers have good reasons to accept outcomes they disagree with? I explore the connections between lottery justification and social risk in democratic contexts.
