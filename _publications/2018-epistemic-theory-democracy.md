This book develops a comprehensive epistemic theory of democracy. We argue that democratic procedures are valuable not only because they respect political equality or express collective autonomy, but because they tend to produce good decisions. Drawing on social choice theory, probability theory, and computer simulations, we show how democratic institutions can aggregate individual knowledge and produce collectively intelligent outcomes.
