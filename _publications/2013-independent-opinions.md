excerpt: 'This paper addresses the claim that opinions are more likely to be correct if they are held independently by many individuals, often used as an argument in social epistemology to defend democratic decision-making on grounds of the wisdom of crowds. The authors distinguish four probabilistic notions of opinion independence and identify causal conditions guaranteeing each kind.'
